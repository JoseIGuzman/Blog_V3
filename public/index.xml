      <description>About Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Jose Ignacio Guzman. This blog showcases my progress with the R programming language, development of other programming/technical skills, and general ideas about geography, technology, and politics.
My academic background is in international affairs. I began learning the R programming language in early 2018 and haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped since. I&amp;rsquo;m mainly interested in GIS, Cartography, data visualization, and data analysis.My hope with this blog is that it will serve as an archive of things I learn, a guide for answering questions, and hopefully a place to teach others along the way.</description>
