## About

Hello, I'm Jose Ignacio Guzman. This blog showcases my progress with the R programming language, development of other programming/technical skills, and general ideas about geography, technology, and politics. 

My academic background is in international affairs. I began learning the R programming language in early 2018 and haven't stopped since. I'm mainly interested in GIS, Cartography, data visualization, and data analysis.My hope with this blog is that it will serve as an archive of things I learn, a guide for answering questions, and hopefully a place to teach others along the way.
